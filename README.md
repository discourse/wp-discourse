wp-discourse
============

This WordPress plugin allows you to **use Discourse as a community engine for your WordPress blog**. The basic function of the plugin is:

- Each WordPress blog post can *optionally* create an associated Discourse topic.

- Periodicially sync the "best" posts in those Discourse topics back to the associated WordPress blog entry as WordPress comments.
