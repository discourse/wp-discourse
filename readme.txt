This plugin allows you to use Discourse as a community engine for your WordPress website. __The plugin is not a substitute for Disqus type commenting systems. Users will need to visit your Discourse forum to comment on your posts.__

== Description ==

The WP Discourse plugin acts as an interface between your WordPress site and your
[Discourse](http://www.discourse.org/) community.

### Use Discourse for comments:

- Automatically creates a forum topic for discussion when a new blog post is published.
- Associates WP author accounts with their respective Discourse accounts. Does not require SSO.
- Replies from the forum discussion can be embedded in the WP blog post. Select which replies to display
based on post score and commenter "trust level" -- see docs.

### Single Sign On from WordPress to Discourse

The plugin also comes with optional SSO functionality which lets you use your WordPress site as the
Single Sign On provider for your Discourse forum.

This will override Discourse's native (and powerful) login flow and is only recommended for use cases
that strictly require such a setup, e.g. a site that is already using WordPress for large scale user management.

### Authentication from Discourse to WordPress

The plugin allows you to use Discourse as an authentication provider for your WordPress site.

### Note

The WP Discourse plugin requires PHP version 5.4.0 and greater. If >=PHP-5.4.0 is not available, the plugin installation
will fail.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it work with a WordPress multisite configuration? =

All of the plugin's functionality except for using Discourse as the SSO provider for WordPress works with multisite configurations.

= Does this plugin install Discourse for me? =

No this plugin acts as an interface between Discourse and WordPress. For it to work you will need to first set up
Discourse forum. You can install Discourse for yourself following either of these guides:

- [Install Discourse in Under 30 Minutes](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/docs/INSTALL-cloud.md)
- [How to use the Discourse One-Click Application on DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-discourse-one-click-application-on-digitalocean)

= Can I import old WordPress comments as Discourse comments (i.e. "replies")? =

No.

= Do WordPress and Discourse have to be installed on the same server? =

The plugin uses the Discourse API, so your forum and blog can be hosted separately and the integration will still work.
In fact, we strongly recommend hosting the two applications separately, since their hosting requirements are very different.

= Is it possible to customize the comment templates? =

Yes, the html templates used for publishing posts on Discourse and for displaying comments on WordPress can be customized in your theme.
This is done by hooking into the filters that are applied to each template.

For more details on template customization, take a look at the [Template Customization](https://meta.discourse.org/t/wp-discourse-template-customization/50754) topic
on the [Discourse Meta](https://meta.discourse.org/) forum.

= Can my Discourse theme inherit the styling of my WordPress theme? =

Not automatically. You need to apply custom HTML&CSS to Discourse in order to match the theme of your WordPress site.
To create a coherent top menu, see our tutorial on how to make a [Custom nav header](https://meta.discourse.org/t/custom-header-with-dropdown-navigation/33451)
